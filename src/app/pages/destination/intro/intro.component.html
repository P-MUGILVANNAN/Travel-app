      <h1>Why Travel?</h1>
      <p>
        Traveling opens the door to new experiences, cultures, and perspectives. It allows you to escape the everyday routine, learn, grow, and reconnect with yourself and others. Whether itâ€™s the thrill of adventure, the joy of discovery, or simply relaxing in a new environment, traveling enriches your life.
